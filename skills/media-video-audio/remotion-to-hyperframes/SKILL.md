# remotion-to-hyperframes

> Port an existing Remotion (React) composition to HyperFrames HTML. Use ONLY when the user explicitly asks to port/convert/migrate/translate a Remotion source. Do NOT use: (a) authoring a new HyperFrames composition; (b) Remotion mentioned in passing; (c) Remotion code shared as reference only; (d) "same video as my Remotion one" without explicit migrate request — treat as fresh build. Doubt → `/general-video`. One-way, Remotion-only: no reverse export (HyperFrames→Remotion or any framework), no non-Remotion source (After Effects, Framer Motion, plain React/CSS) → out of scope, re-create via `/general-video`. Flags unsupported patterns (useState, useEffect, async calculateMetadata, third-party React libs, `@remotion/lambda`) and recommends runtime interop over lossy translation. Unsure whether to port vs. build fresh, or only a passing Remotion mention? → /hyperframes.
